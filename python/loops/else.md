# `else` in loops

You can include an `else` block in the `for` and `while` loops

``` python
for _ in []:
    print('Inside the for loop')
else:
    print('The for loop was not executed')
```

``` python
while False:
    print('Inside the while loop')
else:
    print('The while loop was not executed')
```

> The `else` statement can be used in the try-except-finally structures
