# [Architecture concepts](https://medium.com/@TharunKumarReddyPolu/top-50-system-design-terminologies-you-must-know-3c78f5fb99c1)

1. `Scalability` - The ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work or its potential to accommodate growth
2. `Load balancer` - Divide the incoming traffic among multiple servers so that no single server bears the burden of all the incoming requests.
3. `Microservices` - A software development technique that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services
4. `CAP theorem` - A distributed system can guarantee only two of the following three properties
   - `Consistency`
   - `Availability`
   - `Partition tolerance`
5. `Sharding` - Breaking down a large database into smaller pieces called shards for better management
6. `Latency` - Is the time it takes for data to travel from point A to point B
7. `Throughput` - The quantity of data a system processes in some time frame
8. `Cache` - A component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster
9. `Content Delivery Network (CDN)` - A distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users
10. `REST API` - Architectural style designed to build web services where data is accessed and manipulated using HTTP requests
11. `GraphQL` - A query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. It is more powerful, efficient and flexible than REST
12. `ACID` - Set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures, etc
    - `Atomicity`
    - `Consistency`
    - `Isolation`
    - `Durability`
13. `BASE` - Set of properties that are expected from highly available distributed systems
    - `Basically Available`
    - `Soft state`
    - `Eventual consistency`
14. `SQL` - Structured Query Language. A domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system
15. `NoSQL` - Not only SQL. A kind of database that can store large amounts of data that is not structured. That means it does not necessarily need a fixed schema
