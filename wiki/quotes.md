    Linux supports the notion of a command line or a shell for the same reason
    that only children read books with only pictures in them. Language, be it
    English or something else, is the only tool flexible enough to accomplish
    a sufficiently broad range of tasks.

    Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are,
    by definition, not smart enough to debug it.
                    -- Brian W. Kernighan
