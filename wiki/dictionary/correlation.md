# Correlation

In statistics, correlation or dependence is any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or bivariant data. To calculate it whe use the *phi coefficient (Ï†)*.

If the result is zero, there is no correlation. If the result is 1, there is a perfect correlation. If the result is -1, there is a perfect negative correlation.
