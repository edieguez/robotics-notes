# Method

Piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences

1. A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.
2. A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data).
