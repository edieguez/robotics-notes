## Rules

### First

An adverb of frequency goes before a main verb (except with To Be)

> **subject** + **adverb** + **main_verb**

- I **always** *run* in the park
- He **sometimes** *studies* in the evening

### Second

An adverb of frequency goes after the verb 'To be'

> **subject** + **to be** + **adverb**

- You are **usually** very busy at 2:00 p.m.
- She is **never** very sleepy at night

We can also use the following adverbs at the start of a sentence

1. Usually
1. Normally
1. Often
1. Sometimes

- Often, I like ot eat Thai food

But we cannot us the following at the beginning

1. Always
