# Past continuous (**I was doing**)

**I was doing** something = I was in the middle of doing something at a certain time. **The action** or situation **had already started** before this time, **but had not finished**

- I/he/she/it **was playing** football
- We/you/they **were playing** football

## Middle actions

We often use the [past simple](past_simple.md) and the **past continuous** together to say that something happened in the middle of something else

- Matt **phoned** while **we were having** dinner
- It **was raining** when I **got up**
- I **saw** you in the park yesterday. You **were sitting** on the grass and **reading** a book
- I **hurt** my back while I **was working** in the garden
