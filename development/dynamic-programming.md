# [Dynamic programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk)

Dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.

1. Make it work
   - Visualize the problem as a tree
   - Implement the tree using recursion

2. Make it efficient
   - Add a memo object
   - Add a base case to return memo values
   - Store return values into the memo
