# Nice to have packages

## Portal (use KDE dialog in GTK apps)

```bash
yay -S xdg-desktop-portal xdg-desktop-portal-kde
```

In some cases you'll need to add the following variable to your environment

```bash
export GTK_USE_PORTAL=1
```

## Emoji font

> There are other alternatives with a different design like the ones from Apple

```bash
yay -S noto-fonts-emoji
```
