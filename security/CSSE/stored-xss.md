# Stored cross-site scripting (XSS)

It is also known as **persistent XSS**, **Type-I XSS**, or **persistent client-side script injection**. It occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into a vulnerable application. The injected script is stored on the server and executed when other users access the affected page
