# Code injection

Code injection is a type of attack that involves injecting malicious code into a program or script. The injected code can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the program or script, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system or execute arbitrary commands.

Some examples of code injection attacks include

- **SQL injection**: Injecting malicious SQL queries into an application to manipulate the database.
- **Command injection**: Injecting malicious commands into an application to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system.
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
