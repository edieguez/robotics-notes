# Classes

- A file can contain multiple classes
- At most, only one class per file can be public
- The public class **must** match the filename

## Inner classes

- Is any class whose declaration occurs within the body of another class or interface
- Can contain `final static` fields but not static methods

## Anonymous classes

- Cannot have explicitly defined constructors since they don't have a name

## Static classes

- A class defined inside an interface is implicitly static
