# Constants

- Constants are declared like variables, but with the `const` keyword
- Constants can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values
- **Must be initialized with a value**
- Constants cannot be declared using the `:=` syntax

```go
const Pi = 3.14
const (
    StatusOK = 200
    StatusCreated = 201
    StatusAccepted = 202
    StatusNoContent = 204
)
```
