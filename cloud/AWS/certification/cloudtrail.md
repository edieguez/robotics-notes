# CloudTrail

Provides **governance, compliance and audit** for your AWS account. It enables you to log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services. This event history simplifies security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting.

You can generate a **history of events** and **API calls** by using

- Console
- SDK
- CLI
- AWS services

It is enabled in all regions by default but can be configured to be single region.

**If a resource is deleted, you can still see the event in CloudTrail.**
