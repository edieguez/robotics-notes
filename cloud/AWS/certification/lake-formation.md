# AWS Lake Formation

## Overview

AWS `Lake Formation` is a **fully managed service** designed to simplify the process of building, securing, and managing a **data lake**. A `data lake` is a centralized repository that allows you to store structured and unstructured data at any scale. Lake Formation automates tasks such as:

- `Data ingestion`
- `Data transformation`
- `Access control`

This enables organizations to derive insights faster and more efficiently.
