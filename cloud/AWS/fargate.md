# [Amazon Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate)

Amazon Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both [Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)](ecs.md) and [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](eks.md). Fargate makes it easy for you to focus on building your applications. Fargate removes the need to provision and manage servers, lets you specify and pay for resources per application, and improves security through application isolation by design.
