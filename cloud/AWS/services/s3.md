## Storage classes

### S3 Standard

Offers a balance between performance and cost. It provides strong durability and availability through storing data redundantly across multiple devices and facilities within an AWS region.

### S3 Intelligent-Tiering

Designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.

### S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)

Ideal for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Offers the high durability, throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard, with a low per GB storage price and per GB retrieval fee

### S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)

Ideal for customers who want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data but do not require the availability and resilience of S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA. It is cheaper than S3 Standard-IA
